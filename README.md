# introduction
The goal of this project is to build a basic replicated database. Users can insert data in key/value
pairs via a dedicated format. Users will be able to delete/update key/value pairs in particular
buckets.Simultaneously the user can use the database however as it is a nosql database so we need
to sacrifice CAP theorem property. However all replicas containing data will eventually be
consistent.
